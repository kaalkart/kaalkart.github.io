The course was a beginner-friendly introduction to using the command-line terminal. It started from the basic introduction into computers and computer systems while quickly starting off with the hands-on approach of practical exercises from week 1.

The course taught us a wide array of topics including:

  * the basic commands of the environment,
  * navigating the system,
  * basic and more advanced corpus processing via the environment,
