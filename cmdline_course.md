# Command-Line Tools for Linguists, fall 2024, KIK-LG221

## About the course

The course was a beginner-friendly introduction to using the command-line terminal. It started from the basic introduction into computers and computer systems while quickly starting off with the hands-on approach of practical exercises from week 1.

The course taught us a wide array of topics including:
  * how to install the command-line environment,
  * the basic commands of the environment,
  * navigating the system,
  * basic and more advanced corpus processing via the environment,
  * writing scripts and configuration files using bash,
  * installing and running programs,
  * project development,
  * building webpages using Jekyll and Github.

The following is a weekly more detailed run-down of introductions of the contents of the course.

## Weekly sections of the course: 

### Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

The first week was about setting up the Unix command-line based on what system you use. For me it meant that I had to install the Linux operating system for Windows.For me everything terminal-related was new in this course. So it was a good opportunity for me to learn about the basic commands that I will summarise in the following table.

| Command | What it does |
| :---: | :--- |
| ls | lists the contents of the directory you reside in if not specified otherwise |
| pwd | gives you the full path name of the directory you reside in |
| whoami | gives you the name of the username currently used |
| wget | used with an url to get files from the internet |
| mv | moves or renames files and/or directories |
| cat | fetches the contents of a file and shows it in the terminal |
| less | opens a file for viewing |
| cp | used to copy files and/or directories |
| rm | deletes files and/or directories |
| mkdir | used to create directories |
| cd | moves to a specified directory |

There were also a few instances where we were directed to install homebrew and use a command to install a command or Python:

```
brew install wget
```

```
brew install python3
```

We were also introduced to using text editors via the terminal. In this case we used nano to edit text files:

```
nano <file_name>.txt
```

Therefore the course started with a gentle introduction to the command-line and its use cases.

PS. For me it also meant that I learned to open Ubuntu to get to the terminal and got to know how the logo looks like - <br/><br/> <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/free-ubuntu-logo-icon-download-in-svg-png-gif-file-formats--programming-langugae-freebies-pack-logos-icons-1175076.png?f=webp&w=256" width="100"> <br/><br/>
